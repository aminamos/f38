# README

This project doesn't have specific boundaries yet. The general idea is to access a git repository, find directories in that repo, and download files from those directories. Originally this was supposed to specifically apply to fivethirtyeight's data repository, but if I can make it more general and open to other repos, that might help others as well.

Depending on the completion of those items I might add other features, these will be tracked in a [project](https://github.com/aminamos/f38/projects) board. 

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
